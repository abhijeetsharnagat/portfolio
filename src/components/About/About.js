              Hi there! I'm Abhijeet Sharnagat, a passionate web developer hailing from Pune, India. My journey in the tech world started with hands-on experiences at QuantemJEE Academy and Celebal Technologies, where I delved into the MERN stack, AWS, and the intricacies of ReactJS.

              Skills-wise, I'm your go-to person for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more. Beyond coding, I bring creativity to the table with proficiency in Figma and Adobe Illustrator. Whether it's building a seamless educational platform or enhancing the user experience with Codechef, I thrive on turning ideas into tangible projects.

              Outside the coding realm, you'll find me securing first positions in debate competitions, recognized as the Best UI/UX Designer, and awarded for being the Best Anchor at various events. Currently, I'm the proud founder of Rhetoriciansâ€™ MITAOE, nurturing public speaking, leadership, and community involvement.
